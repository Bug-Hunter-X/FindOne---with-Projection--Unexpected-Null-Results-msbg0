# MongoDB findOne() with Projection: Unexpected Null Results

This repository demonstrates a bug in a MongoDB query using `findOne()` with projection. The query is intended to fetch a document, excluding the `_id` field. However, under specific circumstances, the query returns `null` even when a matching document exists.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript code uses `db.collection('users').findOne()` to search for a document matching the specified criteria.  A projection is included to exclude the `_id` field from the result. In some situations, this leads to an unexpected `null` result despite a document existing that matches the query.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running and a collection named 'users' with at least one document. 
2. Run the code in `bug.js`. Observe that it might unexpectedly return `null` even when a matching document exists.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` offers a potential fix to address the specific issues leading to unexpected `null` results. The solution is further explained in the `solutionContent.md` file
